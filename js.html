    <center><h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1></center>
    <p><b>JavaScript</b> is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. </p>
    <p>Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
    <p><b>&#x2022;Client-side:</b> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.  </p>
    <p><b>&#x2022;Server-side:</b> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js. <br>
    <p><b>Imperative language</b>- In this type of language we are mostly concern about how it is to be done . It simply control the flow of computation . The procedural programming approach , object, oriented approach comes under this like async await we are thinking what it is to be done further after async call. </p>
    <p><b>Declarative programming</b> - In this type of language we are concern about how it is to be done , basically here logical computation require . Here  main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it like  arrow function do .</p>  <hr>
        <b>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</b> 
        
        <p><b>&#x2022;Internal JS:</b> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the &lt;script&gt; tag. The &lt;script&gt; tag can either be placed inside the &lt;head&gt; or the  &lt;body&gt; tag according to the requirement. </p>
        <p><b>&#x2022;External JS:</b> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.js and then link this file inside the &lt;head&gt; tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</p> <br></a>

            <center><h1>History and Features of JS</h1></center>
            <p><b>History of JavaScript:</b> It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser. <br></p> 

            <p><b>Features of JavaScript:</b> According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. <br> <br>
                &#x2022;With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript: <br> <br>
                
                &#x2022; JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made. <br> <br>
                &#x2022; Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions. <br> <br>
                &#x2022;Can handle date and time. <br> <br>
                &#x2022;Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML. <br> <br>
                &#x2022;No compiler is needed.</p>

            <b>Applications of JavaScript:</b> <br> <br>

            &#x2022;<b>Web Development:</b> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily. <br> <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Web Applications:</b> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department. <br> <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Server Applications:</b> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side. <br> <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Games:</b> Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics. <br> <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Smartwatches:</b> JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the internet for its functioning. <br> <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Art:</b> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, and make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library. <br>  <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Machine Learning:</b> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning. <br>
            <br>
            &#x2022;<b>Mobile Applications:</b> JavaScript can also be used to build an application for non-web contexts. The features and uses of JavaScript make it a powerful tool for creating mobile applications. This is a Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript. Using React Native, we can build mobile applications for different operating systems. We do not require to write code for different systems. Write once use it anywhere! <hr>  <br>
